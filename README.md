## <h1 align="center">Sub Domain Enumerator ☠️ ☠️</h1>
## Description: 
    Brute force means guessing possible combinations of the target until the expected output is discovered. 
    So, in the subdomain context, the brute-forcing is to try the possible combination of words, 
    alphabets, and numbers before the main domain in order to get a subdomain that is resolved to IP address.
